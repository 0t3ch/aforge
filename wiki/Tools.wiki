#summary The document provides information about tools being used in the project and information about build process

= Accessing project sources =

To be able to access project sources you will need one of [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] clients. You may use command line utilities to work with source code repository or you can use one of Subversion [http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html GUI and IDE clients]. Personally I prefer to use [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN] client.

When you checked out the project, you should have 2 folders in your file system:
{{{
[AForge Home]
  |- Samples
  \- Sources
}}}

= Working with source codes and building the project =

Once you checked out project sources you will need an IDE to work with them, update them and build. You can use any IDE, which supports .NET 2.0 projects. For example Notepad and command line tool could be fine J. But, if you don't want to lose a lot of time, I would suggest you to download free [http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualcsharp/download/ C# 2005 Express Edition] from Microsoft, which was used for development of the framework.

The first thing to do is to build the AForge.NET libraries, which sources are placed in the *Sources* folder. When you build libraries successfully, you will get *Release* folder with all AForge.NET libraries:
{{{
[AForge Home]
  |- Release
  |- Samples
  \- Sources
}}}

After that, you can go into *Samples* folder and open and build any of the provided samples. Or you can go to the next step and build project documentation.
